Hello!
My name is Maidah Asad, currently an undergraduate student at UMT.
My major is BS(IT). 
I completed my FSC from Kips College Lahore.
I am also currently working as a freelance content writer as well as an Event Manager on the side.
Balancing studies and work gets tiring but it also keeps me grounded.
I would love to work in my field of interest after graduation!
